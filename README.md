# 🎉 Welcome to My Data Analysis Playground! 📊

Hi there! 👋 I'm Claudia, a passionate data analyst with a knack for turning raw data into actionable insights. With practical experience in SQL, Python, and Tableau, I transform numbers into stories and trends into strategies.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **SQL**: I love digging into databases and crafting queries to unearth hidden insights. From complex joins to optimized queries, SQL is my tool of choice for data extraction and manipulation.
  
- **Python**: Whether it's for data cleaning, analysis, or visualization, Python is my Swiss Army knife. Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are my go-to companions for building robust data workflows.

- **Tableau**: I create interactive dashboards that bring data to life. With Tableau, I design intuitive visualizations that make it easy for stakeholders to understand and act on data.
